﻿# AI-Based Civic Issue Monitoring System

## Project Overview

The AI-Based Civic Issue Monitoring System is a geo-fencing enabled mobile and web application designed to help Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) proactively identify and resolve civic issues. The system leverages AI-powered image recognition to automatically detect problems such as potholes, garbage accumulation, debris, stray cattle, broken roads, and open manholes across the city's 19 wards.

## Problem Statement

Currently, civic issues in Vadodara are identified mainly through citizen complaints or feedback, leaving many issues undetected. This reactive approach leads to:
- Delayed problem resolution
- Inconsistent identification across wards
- Lack of data-driven prioritization
- Poor resource allocation

This system transforms the process into a proactive, data-driven approach by enabling VMC employees to conduct field surveys using mobile applications with automated issue detection.

## Key Features

### For Field Surveyors
- Geo-fencing enabled mobile application
- One-click image capture with automatic GPS tagging
- Automatic issue type detection using AI/ML
- Real-time issue submission
- Offline mode support with sync capability

### For Ward Engineers
- Dashboard to view assigned issues
- Issue filtering by priority, type, status, location
- Resolution image upload capability
- Issue close/completion workflow
- Performance metrics and assignment history

### For System Administrators
- System-wide analytics and statistics
- Ward-wise issue heatmaps
- User management (CRUD operations)
- Issue priority distribution analysis
- Department-wise resolution tracking
- System health monitoring

## System Architecture

### Components
1. **Mobile Application** (React Native/Flutter)
   - Geo-location capture
   - Image capture and compression
   - Issue reporting interface
   - Offline support with SQLite

2. **Backend API Server** (Node.js/Python/Java)
   - RESTful API endpoints
   - JWT authentication
   - Geo-fencing logic (using PostGIS)
   - Workflow orchestration
   - Image storage management

3. **AI/ML Service**
   - Computer vision model for issue classification
   - Confidence scoring
   - Multi-class image classification

4. **Database** (PostgreSQL with PostGIS)
   - User and role management
   - Ward boundary data with spatial indexing
   - Issue tracking and history
   - Department mapping

5. **Web Dashboards** (React/Vue)
   - Engineer dashboard (issue assignment and resolution)
   - Admin dashboard (analytics and monitoring)

6. **Third-party Services**
   - Cloud storage (AWS S3/Google Cloud Storage) for images
   - SMS/Email notifications
   - Maps API for ward boundaries

## Vadodara City Structure

- **City Division**: 19 wards
- **Teams Available**: Water Supply, Roads, Garbage, Cattle Control, Drainage
- **Geographical Data**: Ward-wise boundaries (GeoJSON polygons)

## User Roles

| Role | Responsibilities | Access |
|------|------------------|--------|
| **Field Surveyor** | Capture issues via mobile app, submit issue reports with images and GPS | Mobile app, limited to assigned ward |
| **Ward Engineer** | Review assigned issues, verify problems, upload resolution images, close issues | Engineer dashboard, assigned ward issues |
| **Admin** | System monitoring, user management, analytics, configure system parameters | Admin dashboard, system-wide access |

## Issue Types

The system detects and tracks the following civic issues:
- **Potholes** - Road damage
- **Garbage Accumulation** - Trash and waste collection problems
- **Debris** - Scattered waste and rubble
- **Stray Cattle** - Abandoned or roaming livestock
- **Broken Roads** - Damaged road surfaces
- **Open Manholes** - Uncovered utility access points

## Priority Levels

Issues are assigned priority based on:
- **High**: Safety hazards, major infrastructure damage, health risks
- **Medium**: Maintenance issues, moderate inconvenience
- **Low**: Minor issues, cosmetic problems
